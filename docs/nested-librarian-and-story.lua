The librarian framing device offers an elegant model for reorganizing your code files. Just as the story uses a nested narrative structure with an outer frame (the librarian) and an inner story (the allegory about the gate), you could structure your files in a similar layered approach:

## Recommended Organization

### Outer Frame (The Librarian)
The outer frame should serve as your high-level orchestration layer that navigates and describes all your system components:

```
📁 library/
    📄 librarian.py  # Main orchestration module that knows about all components
    📄 registry.yaml # Central registry of all available components and capabilities
    📄 story_teller.py # Interface layer for human interaction
```

### Inner Story (The Gate & Village)
The inner components would be the actual implementation details:

```
📁 gate/
    📄 connectors.py  # Interoperability between languages (like things coming through the gate)
    📁 creatures/     # The different technologies that "come through"
        📄 mojo_adapter.py
        📄 swift_adapter.py 
        📄 cpp_adapter.py
        📄 java_adapter.py
    📄 events.py      # Event handling for gate "activities"
```

### Configuration Integration
For your specific files:

1. Move the technical requirements from "we need to use Magic, Max, modular's pyt.json" into a structured configuration in the registry.yaml file
2. Refactor "2.yaml" to separate:
   - Configuration settings into registry.yaml
   - API specifications into a separate interface definition

This organization mirrors how the librarian (your orchestration layer) tells stories about the gate and village (your actual implementation components). Just as the story maintains unity while having distinct layers, your code would maintain cohesiveness while having clear separation of concerns.

The key insight from the narrative structure is that while you have distinct layers, they should form a unified whole - your configuration files and implementation should tell one coherent "story" about your system.
