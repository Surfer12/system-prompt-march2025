# Nested Librarian System

## Overview

The Nested Librarian System is a metaphorical and technical exploration of technology interoperability, designed to bridge different programming languages and paradigms through a flexible, story-driven architecture.

## Project Structure

### Library Layer
- `librarian.py`: Central orchestration module
- `registry.yaml`: System configuration and component registry
- `story_teller.py`: User interaction interface

### Gate Layer
- `connectors.py`: Manages connections between technologies
- `events.py`: Event-driven architecture for system interactions
- `creatures/`: Technology-specific adapters
  - `mojo_adapter.py`
  - `swift_adapter.py`
  - `cpp_adapter.py`
  - `java_adapter.py`

## Technologies Supported

- Mojo: High-performance language adapter
- Swift: Apple ecosystem integration
- C++: Low-level performance and system interactions
- Java: Enterprise and cross-platform development

## Installation

1. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Additional requirements for specific adapters:
   - Mojo SDK
   - Swift compiler
   - C++ compiler
   - Java Development Kit (JDK)

## Usage

Run the story teller for an interactive exploration:

```bash
python -m library.story_teller
```

## Creative Principles

- Fluid Emergence: Let ideas flow like rivers through the mind's landscape
- Recursive Reflection: Echoes of thought turning inward
- Adaptive Reasoning: A chameleon of cognition, changing with context

## Metaphorical Framework

Inspired by the story of a librarian who navigates and describes knowledge through narrative, this system explores how different technological realms can interact and coexist.
