# Comprehensive Guide to Heaps in Java

## Introduction

Heaps are a type of binary tree-based data structure that satisfy the heap property: in a max-heap, 
every parent node is greater than or equal to its child nodes; in a min-heap, every parent node is 
less than or equal to its child nodes. This guide provides an overview of heaps in Java, focusing 
on their implementation using `PriorityQueue`, and practical use cases.

## Understanding Heaps

### Properties of Heaps
- **Complete Binary Tree:** A heap is a complete binary tree, meaning all levels are fully filled 
except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.
- **Heap Property:**
  - **Max-Heap:** The value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children.
  - **Min-Heap:** The value of each node is less than or equal to the values of its children.

### Types of Heaps
- **Max-Heap:** Used when you need quick access to the largest element.
- **Min-Heap:** Useful for tasks requiring quick access to the smallest element, such as 
scheduling.

## Implementation in Java

Java provides a built-in `PriorityQueue` class that implements the heap data structure. Here’s how 
it can be used:

### Basic Usage
```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public class HeapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a min-heap using default constructor
        PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();

        // Adding elements to the heap
        minHeap.add(10);
        minHeap.add(5);
        minHeap.add(20);

        // Accessing the minimum element (root of the heap)
        System.out.println("Min: " + minHeap.peek());

        // Removing and returning the minimum element
        while (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println(minHeap.poll());
        }
    }
}
```

### Custom Comparator for Max-Heap
To implement a max-heap, you can use a custom comparator:

```java
import java.util.Comparator;
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public class MaxHeapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a max-heap using a custom comparator
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.reverseOrder());

        // Adding elements to the heap
        maxHeap.add(10);
        maxHeap.add(5);
        maxHeap.add(20);

        // Accessing the maximum element (root of the heap)
        System.out.println("Max: " + maxHeap.peek());

        // Removing and returning the maximum element
        while (!maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println(maxHeap.poll());
        }
    }
}
```

## Practical Use Cases

1. **Priority Queues:** Heaps are ideal for implementing priority queues, where elements with 
higher priority (e.g., smaller values in a min-heap) are served before others.

2. **Dijkstra’s Algorithm:** Used for finding the shortest path in graphs, leveraging the 
efficiency of heaps to retrieve the next node with the smallest tentative distance.

3. **Heap Sort:** A comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a heap data structure to sort 
elements in O(n log n) time.

4. **Kth Largest/Smallest Elements:** Heaps can efficiently find the k-th largest or smallest 
element in an unsorted array.

## Advantages of Using Heaps

- **Efficiency:** Operations like insertion, deletion, and access to the minimum or maximum element 
are efficient (O(log n) time complexity).
- **Dynamic Data Handling:** Heaps allow dynamic data handling with constant-time insertions and 
deletions.
- **Memory Efficiency:** Being an in-place sorting algorithm, heapsort has a space complexity of 
O(1).

## Conclusion

Heaps provide a powerful mechanism for managing ordered data efficiently. In Java, the 
`PriorityQueue` class offers a convenient implementation of both min-heaps and max-heaps through 
custom comparators. Understanding and utilizing heaps can significantly enhance performance in 
applications requiring priority-based data handling or efficient sorting.

This guide has covered the essentials of heap operations in Java, including practical examples and 
use cases, to help you effectively implement and leverage this versatile data structure.
# Generic Heap Sort Algorithm

Heap sort is an efficient comparison-based sorting algorithm that leverages a binary heap data 
structure. It works by first building a max-heap (or min-heap) from the input array and then 
repeatedly extracting the maximum element (or minimum element for ascending order) to build the 
sorted array.

Below, I provide a generic implementation of heap sort in Java:

```java
public class HeapSort {

    // Function to perform heapify operation on subtree rooted at index i
    private static void heapify(int[] arr, int n, int i) {
        int largest = i;       // Initialize largest as root
        int leftChildIdx = 2 * i + 1;   // left = 2*i + 1
        int rightChildIdx = 2 * i + 2;  // right = 2*i + 2

        // If left child is larger than root
        if (leftChildIdx < n && arr[leftChildIdx] > arr[largest]) {
            largest = leftChildIdx;
        }

        // If right child is larger than the largest so far
        if (rightChildIdx < n && arr[rightChildIdx] > arr[largest]) {
            largest = rightChildIdx;
        }

        // If largest is not root
        if (largest != i) {
            int swap = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[largest];
            arr[largest] = swap;

            // Recursively heapify the affected sub-tree
            heapify(arr, n, largest);
        }
    }

    // Function to perform heap sort on an array
    public static void heapSort(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;

        // Build a max-heap from the input data
        for (int i = n / 2 - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            heapify(arr, n, i);
        }

        // One by one extract elements from the heap
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            // Move current root to end
            int temp = arr[0];
            arr[0] = arr[i];
            arr[i] = temp;

            // Call max-heapify on the reduced heap
            heapify(arr, i, 0);
        }
    }

    // Utility function to print array of size n
    public static void printArray(int[] arr) {
        for (int value : arr) {
            System.out.print(value + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }

    // Driver code
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7};

        System.out.println("Original array:");
        printArray(arr);

        heapSort(arr);

        System.out.println("Sorted array:");
        printArray(arr);
    }
}
```

## Explanation of the Algorithm

1. **Heapify Function:**
   - The `heapify` function is responsible for maintaining the heap property. Given an index, it 
ensures that the subtree rooted at this index satisfies the max-heap condition.
   - It compares the root with its children and swaps if necessary, then recursively ensures that 
any affected subtrees also satisfy the heap property.

2. **Building the Max-Heap:**
   - The first step in `heapSort` is to build a max-heap from the input array. This starts from the 
last non-leaf node and works upwards.
   - For an array of size `n`, non-leaf nodes are located at indices `[n/2 - 1, n/2 - 2, ..., 0]`.

3. **Extracting Elements:**
   - After building the max-heap, the largest element (root) is swapped with the last element in 
the heap.
   - The size of the heap is reduced by one, and `heapify` is called on the new root to restore the 
heap property.
   - This process repeats until all elements are sorted.

4. **Time Complexity:**
   - Building the heap takes O(n) time.
   - Each extraction from the heap (and subsequent re-heapification) takes O(log n) time, and there 
are `n` such extractions.
   - Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n log n).

This generic implementation of heap sort works for any integer array. The same logic can be adapted 
for other data types by modifying the comparison operations and potentially using a custom 
comparator or similar mechanism if needed.
