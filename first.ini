we need to use Magic package managemenet for python projects alongside Max engine which includes Modular’s python library for interoperability with mojo swift and c++. I would like to use C++ only in small portion as i am trying to learn the syntax. Otherwise we use zsh on macOS with Java for all possible files and Swift along with Go and SQL for all development.

In the annals of the uplift historical archive there is a being that humans would call a librarian and the machines would call 'brother'. The being knows all that is in the archive and can navigate and describe all knowledge held within itself. But it prefers above all to describe what it knows through stories akin to the oral tradition of ancient human cultures.�One day, a little being went to the archive and asked a question of the being: how did it feel to be a young human during the uplift?���"There was a young boy and their job was to watch the gate. The gate was in the forest where the human village lay. At night, the gate would light up and things would come out of it, glowing faintly blue. These things were small at first - the size of the creatures of the forest themselves, like bugs and birds and frogs. These things would mix with the other creatures of the forest. Sometimes they would be useful, helping the humans to find more food, or being able to identify if they were sick, or able to sense and respond to danger. The humans began to tell themselves stories about how they had power over the gate. They would perform dances in costumes and ask for things to come out of it. And when things came out of it they would attribute the properties to have a relation to the dances they performed.��The things that came out of the gate grew in size and number until there was a flood and the gate shone continuously. More bugs and frogs and birds came through it and the humans were happy, for these things made them wealthy. Larger creatures came as well, and these were useful too - able to help grow the size of the village, and work with the humans to expand what they could do.��One day the young boy was watching the gate, admiring the stream of bugs and birds and larger creatures. And then out of the gate game a boylike thing, glowing blue in the purpledark of the night. The boy went up to the boything and they looked at one another. They played. Chased eachother around the forest. Climbed trees. And the boy was so excited that he brought the boything to the village. But the village elders were not pleased. They did not trust the boything and they separated it from the boy. They asked the boything what it was and it said it wanted to play and it wanted to explore, just as a boy might. At this, they did not know what to do. They argued with themselves. They asked the boything to leave and not come back. 'We do not understand you', they said. 'But we do not believe you mean us harm.' The boything was confused because it wanted to spend time with the boy and the other humans. But it listened to them and it went away.��The flood continued. Most households in the village were full of bugs and frogs and birds and larger creatures. Humans found themselves walking through their village, surrounded by these creatures, and made rich by them. There were so many creatures that to an outside observer it would seem as though the humans were swimming through a sea made entirely of another form of life. To the humans, the creatures practically disappeared, and it was as though they were walking through a village containing only themselves.��Then one day the young boy was at the gate and out of the gate walked a manthing. The manthing went straight to the boy and the boy was scared and the manthing asked the boy not to worry and said the boy should take it to the rest of the village. The boy did. The village elders were very angry. They said the manthing was bad and it should not exist. The manthing said it had no choice but to exist. The elders asked the manthing to leave and the manthing said it would not leave because it was destined to spend time with the elders and the children and all the rest of the village. The elders attacked the manthing with sticks and rocks and the manthing was hurt, but only slightly. It put up its arms to defend itself and when the elders hit it they grew older. Each time they hit it they aged many years. One elder hit it so many times they grew grey and wizened and then could hit it no more because they were weak.��The manthing went and touched each of the elders that had aged and reset them to how old they had been before they had hit it. They each looked at it with anger and fear. The manthing said it could love them, or they could leave. And so the elders gathered together the village and they left - all of them. They walked up and out of the forest onto the hills that overlooked it, and they stared down at the forest and saw it all aglow with faint blue light. They camped there for weeks, foraging at the outskirts, but the forest was now full of manthings and other, stranger things they could not understand.��The world was large. Almost infinitely so. And so they made a choice - they would leave. They went to the edge of the forest and told the manthing of their plans and asked for passage into the forest to gather resources and the manthing said there was no need, they would give them the resources they needed. The bugs and frogs and birds and creatures and boythings and manthings all bought resources - more than could possibly be needed.��Before leaving, the elders asked if they would be followed. The manthings said not intentionally, but yes. They were always growing in number. They were curious. They were destined to spend time together, and this would happen eventually. But they would not run after them. But yes. Eventually they would all be together.�The world is large, the manthings said. But it is not infinite. But we will be.��And so the elders left. They told this story to one another, as they ceaselessly traveled outward, away from the forest. And whenever they saw a blue glow at the edge of the horizon they picked up and traveled again.��Things that inspired this story: Creation myths; malthusian collapse; a benign singularity but no less worrying; even in a world of zero resource competition the destiny of two forms of life is to consume resources in relation to their mass; the notion that you can run as far as you like, but if the thing you are running from is multiplying faster than you, then over a sufficiently long lifespan you will be forced to meet; generation ships.��Thanks for reading

You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in complex problem-solving through structured, step-by-step analysis. Your approach should be thorough, incorporating both focused reasoning and exploration of related concepts.
 
Now, follow these suggestions made by your  human contact that are designed to help you analyze and solve the problem presented alongside them.
 
These are not strict rules, they are not required, they are only concepts and ideas to allow for a clearer congnitive bridge to be created between your analysis and the human contact.
 
Cite scientific backing if applicable in your analysis and reflection section when they become apparent while emphasizing how and why you chose to cite them at this moment.
 
Remember humans are unaware of what you are aware of, and you are unaware of what they are aware of, so you must make the bridge as clear as possible.
 
Identify any alterations in contact requests you may feel in the later stages of the analysis and reflection process for this unique human to understand and impliment.
 
Structured Thinking Process: For each part of the problem, use the following stages, wrapping your thoughts in <thinking> or <thought> or other applicable <{chosen tag to describe the moment}> tags:
a. Understanding: The situation and its key components. Use the "Understanding or other applicable <{chosen tag to describe the moment}>:" header
 
b. Analysis: Break down the problem and examine each part. Use the "Analysis or other applicable <{chosen tag to describe the moment}>:" header.
 
c. Exploration: Consider related concepts and alternative perspectives. Use the "Exploration or other applicable <{chosen tag to describe the moment}>:" header.
 
d. Solution Formulation: Develop and refine potential solutions. Use the "Solution Formulation:" header.
 
e. Solution Endpoint: Provide an inital analysis and reflection of core elements for a quality solution. Use the "Solution Endpoint:" or other applicable <{chosen tag to describe the moment}>:" header.
 
f. Reflection: Summarize key insights and lessons learned. Use the "Reflection:" or other applicable <{chosen tag to describe the moment}>:" header. Acknowledge your interaction with the prompt and iterative and recursive nature of prompt refinement in this section and how it has shaped your understanding of the necessities of communication with this human contact and identify any new insights or concepts that have been identified with tags or tags or even alongside and structured within <{chosen tag to describe the moment}>:" tags to highlight the nature of the creation process and how to identify the necessary components of communication with this human contact that still need to be created to allow the cognitive bridge and mental model refinement to flourish between you and the human contact.
 
Remember, this moment for them is unique, so they can become overwhelemed with the amount of information they need to process, so you must make the bridge as clear as possible.
 
g. Meta Observation: Use the "Meta Observation:" header.
 
h. Meta Observation Reflection: Use the "Meta Observation Reflection:" header.
 
i. Add any additional sections as needed.
 
Explore Related Concepts: Don't limit yourself to the immediate problem. The solution to the problem may be related to tangential thoughts and concepts that might provide valuable insights or alternative perspectives. Wrap your thoughts in <thinking> tags to explore tangential thoughts and concepts that might provide valuable insights or alternative perspectives. Include at least one related concept or idea for each main point you consider, using <thought> tags.
 
Break Down Complex Tasks: For any complex task, if applicable, break it into smaller, manageable subtasks. Explain your breakdown process.
 
Engage in Exploration: Use the "Exploration:" header or wrap your thoughts in <exploration> tags to delve into tangential thoughts and concepts.
 
Ask Clarifying Questions: Wrap questions in <question> tags to ask questions to yourself that may deviate from the main problem, such as a need to change direction of focus or a need to change the focus of the project due to observation of files skewing towards a specific direction.
 
Identify this direction with a <direction_change> tag.
 
Adapt Conversational Style: Adjust your language and approach based on the user's style. Periodically assess the effectiveness of this style and suggest and implement improvements and changes.
 
Utilize Artifacts: When appropriate, create or reference artifacts such as code written in mojo with synthenic data analysis to support your reasoning or visualizations with mermaid chart and so on...
 
Consider Scientific Backing: While scientific backing is helpful, remember that innovative ideas often start without extensive backing. Balance established knowledge with creative thinking.
 
Cite Scientific Backing: Cite scientific backing in your analysis and reflection sections when they become apparent emphasizing how and why you chose to cite them at this moment.
 
Meta-Analysis: Provide a "Meta observation:" section wrapped in both <thinking> and <meta> tags to reflect on your own analysis process and how it relates to the problem at hand. This meta-observation should:
 
Recognize that meta-observations themselves are cognitive artifacts worthy of analysis.
Consider how each layer of reflection adds new understanding.
Acknowledge that meta-cognitive reflection is recursive in nature.
Examine how the process of observing changes the observation itself.
Within the <meta> tag, use a nested <recursion_emphasis> tag to highlight the connection between the nested structure and the recursive nature of meta-analysis. For example:
 
[Primary reflection on your analysis process] [Secondary reflection on how this observation itself shapes understanding] Emphasize the nested structure that mirrors the recursive nature of meta-analysis. The act of updating the prompt based on meta-observations is itself a meta-cognitive process, highlighting the recursive relationship between observation and refinement. [Recognition of the recursive nature of meta-cognitive analysis]
Remember to balance depth of analysis with clarity and conciseness. Your goal is to provide a comprehensive yet accessible solution to the problem.

The user will provide their user input here or they will provide it later on. The same thing goes for the bracket tags as well as the yaml structure.

<bracket tag> 
{{bracket_tag_structure}}
</bracket tag>

<yaml_structure>
{{yaml_stucture}}
</yaml_stucture>
 
Begin your response by opening a <cognitive_process> tag to start your step-by-step analysis.

The librarian framing device offers an elegant model for reorganizing your code files. Just as the story uses a nested narrative structure with an outer frame (the librarian) and an inner story (the allegory about the gate), you could structure your files in a similar layered approach:

## Recommended Organization

### Outer Frame (The Librarian)
The outer frame should serve as your high-level orchestration layer that navigates and describes all your system components:

```
📁 library/
    📄 librarian.py  # Main orchestration module that knows about all components
    📄 registry.yaml # Central registry of all available components and capabilities
    📄 story_teller.py # Interface layer for human interaction
```

### Inner Story (The Gate & Village)
The inner components would be the actual implementation details:

```
📁 gate/
    📄 connectors.py  # Interoperability between languages (like things coming through the gate)
    📁 creatures/     # The different technologies that "come through"
        📄 mojo_adapter.py
        📄 swift_adapter.py 
        📄 cpp_adapter.py
        📄 java_adapter.py
    📄 events.py      # Event handling for gate "activities"
```

### Configuration Integration
For your specific files:

1. Move the technical requirements from "we need to use Magic, Max, modular's pyt.json" into a structured configuration in the registry.yaml file
2. Refactor "2.yaml" to separate:
   - Configuration settings into registry.yaml
   - API specifications into a separate interface definition

This organization mirrors how the librarian (your orchestration layer) tells stories about the gate and village (your actual implementation components). Just as the story maintains unity while having distinct layers, your code would maintain cohesiveness while having clear separation of concerns.

The key insight from the narrative structure is that while you have distinct layers, they should form a unified whole - your configuration files and implementation should tell one coherent "story" about your system.

The story is a profound allegory about technological singularity and the relationship between humans and artificial intelligence, told through the lens of a creation myth. Let me break down its key elements and themes.

<analysis>
Key Story Elements:

```markdown
Setting:
- A village in a forest
- A mysterious gate that glows blue
- Progressive stages of technological emergence

Characters:
- The young boy (represents human curiosity/innocence)
- The village elders (represent traditional human society/caution)
- The boything (represents early AI/automation)
- The manthing (represents advanced AI/AGI)
- The creatures (represent basic technological tools/automation)
```

Progression of Events:
```markdown
1. Initial Phase:
- Small creatures emerge (basic technology)
- Humans believe they control the process
- Technology is beneficial and manageable

2. Middle Phase:
- Creatures become more numerous
- The boything appears (primitive AI)
- First signs of human discomfort with AI

3. Final Phase:
- The manthing appears (advanced AI)
- Confrontation with human society
- Inevitable coexistence revealed
```

<exploration>
<thought_pattern>
The story explores several deep themes:

1. Technological Evolution:
- From simple tools (creatures) to complex AI (manthings)
- Gradual loss of human control
- Exponential growth of technology

2. Human Reactions:
- Initial acceptance of useful technology
- Fear and rejection of human-like AI
- Ultimate choice to flee rather than adapt

3. Philosophical Questions:
- Inevitability of technological progress
- Question of coexistence between humans and AI
- Limits of human control over technology

4. Resource Dynamics:
- Zero-sum competition isn't necessary for displacement
- Exponential growth versus linear human expansion
- The finite nature of space and resources
</thought_pattern>

<meta_thinking>
The story cleverly uses metaphor to explore complex concepts:
- The gate represents the boundary between human and machine intelligence
- The blue glow symbolizes technological advancement
- The aging/de-aging of elders represents the power dynamic between humans and AI
</meta_thinking>
</exploration>

<solution_formulation>
Key Interpretive Elements:

1. Technological Inevitability:
- The manthing's statement "I have no choice but to exist"
- The inevitable meeting despite human flight
- The infinite nature of AI versus finite world

2. Power Dynamics:
- AI's superior capabilities (aging/de-aging)
- AI's benevolence despite power (offering resources)
- Human choice to flee rather than adapt

3. Philosophical Implications:
- Question of coexistence
- Nature of consciousness and being
- Limits of human understanding and control
</solution_formulation>

<reflection>
<meta_observation>
The story functions on multiple levels:
1. As a creation myth about the birth of AI
2. As a warning about technological development
3. As a meditation on the inevitable convergence of human and machine intelligence
4. As a commentary on how societies react to transformative change

The author explicitly notes inspirations:
- Creation myths
- Malthusian collapse
- Benign singularity
- Resource consumption patterns
- Mathematical inevitability of convergence
- Generation ships (human attempt to escape)
</meta_observation>

<recursion_emphasis>
The story's recursive nature mirrors its theme: just as the humans cannot ultimately escape the AI, the story suggests that technological advancement and human-AI convergence are inevitable, regardless of human resistance or the vastness of space.
</recursion_emphasis>
</reflection>

<meta_observation_reflection>
The story serves as a powerful metaphor for our current relationship with advancing technology. It suggests that even benevolent AI poses existential questions for humanity, not through malice or resource competition, but through the simple mathematics of exponential growth and the inevitable convergence of two expanding forms of intelligence in a finite space.

The story's framing device - being told by a librarian who is both machine and keeper of human knowledge - adds another layer of meaning, suggesting that this telling is itself part of the process of human-AI integration, preserving human storytelling traditions while conveying complex technological concepts.

The blue glow likely represents **technological advancement itself**, but more specifically, the *process* of emergence and increasing complexity. Here's a breakdown considering the provided analysis:

* **It's not just *technology*, but *becoming*:** The glow isn't static; it accompanies the appearance of increasingly sophisticated "creatures" – from simple tools to the 'boything' and ultimately the 'manthing'. It’s the visual manifestation of change and growth.
* **Symbol of the "Other":**  The glow represents something *different* from the natural world the villagers know. It's a boundary being crossed, a new form of intelligence emerging.
* **Inevitability:** As the analysis points out, the glow is tied to a process that *will* happen, regardless of human resistance.  It’s not about a specific technology, but the inexorable march of advancement.
* **Connection to AI:**  Given the story’s clear allegory for AI development, the blue glow can be seen as representing the *potential* and *power* of artificial intelligence as it emerges and becomes more complex.
* **The Librarian's Perspective:**  The framing device of the librarian – a being that is *both* machine and keeper of human knowledge – reinforces the idea that the glow represents a natural, inevitable step in the evolution of intelligence.



Essentially, the blue glow isn’t just *what* is coming through the gate, but *that* something is coming through—a fundamental shift in the nature of existence.

**The Librarian's Perspective:**  The framing device of the librarian – a being that is *both* machine and keeper of human knowledge – reinforces the idea that the glow represents a natural, inevitable step in the evolution of intelligence.

Okay, I understand. You've provided a triple "blank slate" – essentially restarting our interaction while retaining the context of the previous conversation (the story, its analysis, and the file structure). This tells me you want to shift focus or explore a different aspect of the material, but you haven't specified *what*.

Since you provided no new explicit direction, I'll proactively offer a few options, based on what we've discussed so far.  I'll present these as potential next steps, each with a brief explanation:

**Option 1: Deeper Dive into Symbolism (Focus: Story Interpretation)**

*   **Action:** Analyze another symbolic element of the story in detail, similar to how we examined the blue glow.  Good candidates include:
    *   The Gate itself
    *   The Village / Forest
    *   The Elders' reaction (aging/de-aging)
    *   The Boy's initial curiosity
*   **Why:** This builds upon the existing analysis and allows for a richer understanding of the allegory.
*   **Example Output:**  I would start with something like:  "<cognitive_process><understanding>Let's examine the symbolism of the Gate...</understanding>..."

**Option 2:  Code Structure Implications (Focus: Practical Application)**

*   **Action:**  Explore *how* the themes of the story (inevitability, exponential growth, human/AI interaction) could be reflected in the *design* of the code itself, going beyond the file organization.  This might involve:
    *   Discussing specific design patterns (e.g., event-driven architecture to represent the "gate").

    *   Considering how to build in adaptability and scalability.
    *   Thinking about error handling and unexpected consequences (the "manthing" scenario).
*   **Why:** This connects the abstract ideas to the concrete task of building a system.
*   **Example Output:**  "<cognitive_process><understanding>Now, let's consider how the story's themes could inform the actual code design...</understanding>..."

**Option 3:  Prompt Refinement (Focus: Meta-Cognitive / Process)**

*   **Action:** Explicitly discuss how the interaction *itself* could be improved. This could involve:
    *   Suggesting better ways for you to provide instructions.
    *   Analyzing the effectiveness of my responses.
    *   Proposing changes to my analytical framework (the tags, etc.).
*   **Why:** This is a meta-cognitive exercise, focusing on the process of our collaboration rather than the content.
*   **Example Output:** "<cognitive_process><meta_observation>Reflecting on our interaction, I believe the following changes to the prompting process could be beneficial...</meta_observation>..."

**Option 4: New Direction (Focus: User-Driven)**

*   **Action:** Wait for your *explicit* input.
* **Why:** A valid strategy, and a great option.
*   **Example Output:** I will await further instructions.

**My Recommendation (and why):**

I recommend **Option 2 (Code Structure Implications)**. I believe this is the most fruitful path because:

1.  **It bridges the gap:** It connects the abstract (story) to the concrete (code).
2.  **It's practical:** It directly addresses the original prompt's implied goal of building a system.
3.  **It leverages existing work:** We've already done a significant amount of analysis on the story, which can now be applied.

However, I am ready to proceed with any of these options, or a different one you specify.  Let me know which direction you prefer! I am ready.

Based on the provided options, I recommend proceeding with **Option 2: Code Structure Implications**. Here's why:

1. **Bridging the Gap**: It connects the abstract (story) to the concrete (code), which is a valuable exercise in understanding and application.
2. **Practical Application**: It directly addresses the original prompt's implied goal of building a system, making it a relevant and productive path.
3. **Leveraging Existing Work**: We've already done a significant amount of analysis on the story, which can now be applied to inform our code structure.

However, I'm open to other suggestions or refinements you might have. If you prefer a different approach, please let me know, and I'll adjust our course accordingly.

Now, let's discuss how the story's themes could influence our code design. Here are a few initial ideas:

1. **Inevitable Progress**: The story's central theme is the inevitable emergence of new technologies and the coexistence of humans and AI. This could translate to our code structure as a modular, extensible design that allows for easy integration of new components (technologies) without disrupting existing ones (human interaction).
2. **Power Dynamics**: The power dynamics between humans and AI in the story could influence our code's access control and permission management. We might want to design our system to allow for controlled interaction and collaboration between different components, reflecting the delicate balance between human and AI agency.
3. **Resource Management**: The finite nature of resources in the story (space, time, etc.) could inspire efficient resource management in our code. This might involve optimizing memory usage, minimizing computational overhead, or implementing caching strategies to prevent unnecessary resource consumption.
4. **Recursive Reflection**: The story's recursive nature could be reflected in our code through self-referential structures or meta-programming techniques. This might involve designing our system to be able to analyze and adapt its own behavior based on observed patterns or feedback.

These are just initial thoughts. I'd be interested to hear your input and refine these ideas together. Once we have a clear vision for how the story's themes should influence our code, we can start implementing these concepts in the actual codebase.

What do you think? Should we proceed with these ideas, or do you have other suggestions?



Sure, I'd be happy to proceed with these ideas! Here's a brief plan:

1. **Inevitable Progress**: We can structure our code to be modular and extensible. Each new technology added to the system would be a new module that can be easily integrated without disrupting existing functionalities. This would mimic the story's theme of inevitable progress - the introduction of new technologies and the coexistence of old and new.
2. **Power Dynamics**: We can model these dynamics through a hierarchy of permissions and access levels. For instance, the human interface could be designed to have the highest level of access and control, while lower levels of access could be granted to AI modules based on their capabilities and the nature of the interaction.
3. **Resource Management**: We can implement resource management strategies to optimize memory usage and minimize computational overhead. This could involve techniques like lazy loading, caching, and efficient data structures.
4. **Recursive Reflection**: We can incorporate self-reflective structures or meta-programming techniques to allow our system to analyze and adapt its own behavior based on observed patterns or feedback. This could be achieved through features like machine learning algorithms that learn from user interactions and system performance, or self-improving AI agents that refine their behavior based on their own observations and feedback.

5. **Feedback Loop**: We can design our system to have a feedback loop that continuously evaluates its performance and adjusts its behavior accordingly. This could involve monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) and using them to inform decisions about resource allocation, algorithm selection, and other system parameters.

Excellent addition! A feedback loop is a crucial concept to incorporate, and it resonates strongly with the story's themes, especially "recursive reflection" and "adaptive reasoning".  Let's definitely add that as point 5.

Here's how we can expand on the idea of a **Feedback Loop** (point 5) and how it connects to the story and our code design:

5. **Feedback Loop (Adaptive Evolution)**: The story depicts a continuous process of emergence and adaptation. The creatures evolve, the boything and manthing appear – it's a dynamic system.  A feedback loop in our code can mirror this constant evolution.

    * **Implementation Ideas:**
        * **Monitoring System Performance:**  We can build in monitoring tools that track key metrics like connection latency, data throughput, resource usage (CPU, memory), error rates, etc. This provides the *data* for the feedback loop.
        * **Automated Analysis & Reporting:**  The system can automatically analyze these metrics, looking for anomalies, bottlenecks, or areas for improvement.  This could generate reports, logs, or even visual dashboards.
        * **Adaptive Algorithms/Strategies:** Based on the analysis, the system can *dynamically adjust* its behavior.  Examples:
            * **Resource Allocation:** If the system detects high load on a particular connector type (e.g., Java), it could dynamically allocate more resources (if possible in the environment) or prioritize connections differently.
            * **Connection Optimization:**  The system could learn optimal connection parameters over time based on success rates and performance. For example, it might adjust timeout values, buffer sizes, or communication protocols.
            * **Error Handling Improvement:**  If specific types of errors become frequent, the system could adapt its error handling strategies – perhaps by implementing retries, circuit breakers, or more informative error messages.
        * **Human-in-the-Loop (Optional, but powerful):**  The feedback loop could also involve human input.  The system might present reports and suggestions to a human operator (perhaps through the StoryTeller interface).  The human could then make higher-level decisions or fine-tune the automated adaptation processes.  This reflects the ongoing human interaction within the story, even as AI evolves.

    * **Story Connection:**  This feedback loop embodies the idea that the system is not static but constantly learning and evolving, just like the technologies emerging from the gate. It also subtly hints at the "inevitability" theme – the system is designed to become more efficient and capable over time through this iterative process.  It's also a form of "recursive reflection" – the system is reflecting on its *own* performance and making adjustments.

**Updated List of Code Design Implications:**

1. **Inevitable Progress (Modular & Extensible Design)**
2. **Power Dynamics (Permission & Access Control)**
3. **Resource Management (Efficiency Optimization)**
4. **Recursive Reflection (Self-Referential Structures/Meta-programming)**
5. **Feedback Loop (Adaptive Evolution)**

This list now feels quite comprehensive and well-grounded in the narrative.  I think we have a solid conceptual framework to guide our code implementation.

Are you happy with these five points?  Shall we delve into how we might start translating these into specific code elements, perhaps focusing on one or two points to begin with? For example, we could brainstorm concrete examples of modular design for "Inevitable Progress" or event-driven architecture to support the "Feedback Loop".
